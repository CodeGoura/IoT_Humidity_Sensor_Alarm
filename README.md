# IoT_Humidity_Sensor_Alarm
This repository hosts a comprehensive IoT project for building a humidity sensor alarm system using Python, IoT devices, and cloud services
The project aims to monitor humidity levels in a specific environment and trigger alarms or notifications when the humidity exceeds or falls below predefined thresholds. It leverages IoT devices, cloud platforms, and automation to provide real-time monitoring and alerts for humidity-related issues.
Key Features:

IoT Device Integration: The project integrates IoT devices like humidity sensors, microcontrollers (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino), and connectivity modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) to collect humidity data from the environment.

Real-time Data Collection: The system continuously collects humidity data from the connected sensor(s) and securely transmits it to a cloud platform for real-time monitoring.

Cloud Data Storage: The repository includes scripts for storing the collected data in a cloud-based database or storage service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or a third-party IoT platform).

Threshold Configuration: The system allows users to set configurable humidity thresholds for triggering alarms. When the humidity levels exceed or fall below these thresholds, the alarm system is activated.

Notification Mechanism: The project provides notification capabilities, such as sending email alerts, SMS messages, or push notifications, when humidity thresholds are breached. Users can customize notification preferences.

Data Visualization: The repository may include code for data visualization, which allows users to monitor historical humidity trends through interactive graphs or dashboards.

Automated Actions: Depending on the severity of humidity issues, the system may support predefined automated actions, such as turning on or off a humidifier or dehumidifier, controlling HVAC systems, or notifying maintenance personnel.

Scalability: The project design allows for easy scalability, enabling the addition of more sensors or integration with other IoT devices and sensors for comprehensive environmental monitoring.

Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local development environment.

Review the documentation provided within the repository to understand the hardware requirements, dependencies, and setup instructions.

Configure your IoT devices and cloud platform credentials to establish the data collection and transmission process.

Customize threshold values according to your specific environmental requirements.

Configure notification mechanisms to receive alerts when humidity thresholds are breached.

Run the system, and it will continuously monitor humidity levels, trigger alarms, and send notifications as needed.
